  This study numerically investigates a cylinder–plate–cylinder (C-P-C) system to reveal how wake-induced and wake-interference mechanisms interact to shape flow-induced vibration responses. The results identify seven distinct dynamic regimes and demonstrate how spacing ratios control the onset of wake-interference galloping and extended VIV lock-in.
