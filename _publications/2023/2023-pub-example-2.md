  This study uses Large-Eddy Simulation to examine how transverse inclination angle influences flow patterns and hydrodynamic forces in tandem cylinders arranged in an X configuration at Re = 3900. A critical inclination (α = 12.5°–15°) triggers a transition from reattachment to co-shedding, sharply increasing downstream forces and revealing key mechanisms governing wake interactions and structural loading.
