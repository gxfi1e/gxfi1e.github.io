    I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), specializing in flow-induced vibration, wake dynamics, and vibration-based energy harvesting. My work combines numerical simulation and fluid–structure interaction modeling to advance the fundamental understanding of wake interference and to develop efficient FIV-based energy systems.
